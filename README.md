# Car_Sellingprice_prediction

# Objective:-

The primary objective of the "Car-sellingprice-prediction" project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the selling prices of cars based on various features such as Year, Kilometers driven, Fuel type, transmission, seller type, owner and other relevant attributes. This prediction tool aims to assist car sellers and buyers in making informed decisions by providing a reliable estimate of a car's market value.

# Project Description:-

The "Car-sellingprice-prediction" project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze and predict car selling prices. The project involves several key steps:

1. Data Collection: Gathering a comprehensive dataset that includes car features and their corresponding selling prices.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring that the data is suitable for analysis.
3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features and selecting the most relevant ones to improve the predictive power of the model.
4. Model Training: Implementing various machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting to train models on the dataset.
5. Prediction: Using the best-performing model to predict the selling prices of cars, providing users with an estimated market value based on the input features.

By accurately predicting car selling prices, this project aims to enhance the transparency and efficiency of the car buying and selling process, benefiting both individual consumers and businesses in the automotive market.
